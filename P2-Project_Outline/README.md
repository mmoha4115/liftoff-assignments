The web app is for avid book reader and book club. I wanted to join a book club and
notice lack central resource for book. The users will be able to select the book they are
currently reading and add fruits/perspective for each chapter they read as a non book club user.
The users can also join book club and add fruits to each chapter of the book selected by book club owner ie
book being read by book club members. the book club fruits can be private to only the book club or public to be viewed by all user on web app.
Users can search for book clubs by different criteria.
